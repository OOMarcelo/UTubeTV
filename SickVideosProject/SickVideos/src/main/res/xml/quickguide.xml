        <text>The first thing you'll see is the 'about page' of the default channel</text>
        <text>Every channel has an about page with an image and a description of the channel</text>

        <text>Changing channels is simple.  Click on the popup menu control on the left side of the action bar at the top of the screen.</text>
        <text>To navigate within the current channel. Show the slide out navigation drawer by clicking the top left icon in the action bar, or by swiping from the right side of the screen.</text>
        <text>The navigation drawer contains the About page, Playlists and Recent Uploads page.</text>

        <text>YouTube has an incredible selection of interesting videos.  The problem is finding those videos and keeping track of channels you like.</text>
        <text>Sure there are subscriptions, but after subscribing to dozens of channels, now you have to navigate though a large subscription list every time you feel like watching a video.</text>
        <text>Launching apps is the simplest most straight forward UI on a mobile device.  It's clear and does one clear task.  Wouldn't it be nice if you were in the mood for tech videos you could just click the tech videos app?</text>
        <text>This is what this application attempts to do. Make watching videos a little bit simpler.</text>
        <text>And there are additional apps just like this you can download that cover additional topics.</text>
