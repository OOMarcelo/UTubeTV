<h3>Hello!</h3>
<h4>Thanks for downloading my app!</h4>

<p>
    This app contains multiple related YouTube channels to make it easy to watch videos that
    interest you. YouTube has a great app, but it can be overwhelming to deal with dozens of
    subscriptions, navigating around
    and waiting for YouTube to load it's content. This app aims to be simple with no surprises.
    Just click the videos you want to watch. No ads, no junk, just videos.

</p>

<p>

    This app caches most information so it's fast!
</p>

<h4>Quick start</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Change channels using the popup menu in the action bar</li>
    <li>Swipe to hide cards</li>
    <li>To unhide a card, choose "Show hidden items" in the action menu. Then click to unhide any
        cards previously hidden
    </li>
    <li>Use the slide out drawer to navigate sections of the current channel</li>
    <li>Pull down the list to refresh</li>

</ul>


<h4>I need you help!</h4>

<p>
    I want to make the best app possible, so don't hesitate to send feedback.
    I spend all day coding and not enough time using it for real, so your feedback is valuable.
</p>

<p>
    Did I pick the right channels? Let me know if you have suggestions.
</p>

<p>
    If you have an idea for a similar app
    compile a list 4-6 related YouTube channels and send them to me.
    If I like the idea, I'll make the app. I'm hoping to create dozens of apps to cover
    a wide range of interests.
