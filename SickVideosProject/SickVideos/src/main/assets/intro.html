<h4>Thanks for downloading my app!</h4>

<p>
    This app contains multiple related YouTube channels to make it easy to watch videos that
    interest you. YouTube has a great app, but it can be overwhelming to deal with dozens of
    subscriptions
    and waiting for YouTube to load it's content.

</p>

<p>

    This app caches most information so it's fast!
</p>

<h4>Quick start</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Change channels using the popup menu in the action bar</li>
    <li>Swipe to hide cards</li>
    <li>To unhide a card, choose "Show hidden items" in the action menu. Then click to unhide any
        cards previously hidden
    </li>
    <li>Use the slide out drawer to navigate sections of the current channel</li>

</ul>


<h4>I need you help!</h4>

<p>
    Did I pick the right channels? Let me know if you have suggestions.
</p>

<p>
    If you have an idea for a similar app
    Find 4-6 related YouTube channels and send them to me.
    If I like the idea, I'll make an app.
